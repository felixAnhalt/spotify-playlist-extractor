# System Patterns

This file documents recurring architectural patterns, design principles, and coding standards used in the project.

## Patterns

1. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each module or function should have one and only one reason to change.
2. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Avoid duplication by abstracting reusable logic.
3. **Functional Programming**: Emphasize immutability and pure functions where possible.
4. **Clean Code Practices**: Write code that is simple, clear, and easy to maintain.

## Standards

- Follow project-specific coding guidelines.
- Ensure all functions are documented.
- Write tests for high-level functions only.
